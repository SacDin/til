# Reinstall global packages when you change nodejs version

I had not looked at this last time but
found out a [handy tip](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#migrating-global-packages-while-installing) in nvm's readme.

```shell
nvm install 8.9.4 --reinstall-packages-from=6.11.0
```

And, you have all the global packages from your previous version.
